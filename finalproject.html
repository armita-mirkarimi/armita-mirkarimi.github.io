  <!-- This is my subtitle -->
  <h2 style="background: #FFFFFF; color: #000000;">
    
    Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has been riddled with bursts of protest with various causes and flashpoints.
    From the closure of reformist newspapers and election integrity to price hikes, Iran's protests in the modern day 
    are essential features in understanding life under the Islamic Republic. On this page, I walk through the following protests 
    in recent Iranian history: 
    
    <ol style="font-family: georgia; color: #800000;">
      
      <li>The 1999 Student Protests</li>
      <li>The 2009 Green Movement</li>
      <li>The 2017-18 Economic Protests</li>
      <li>2019 Price Hike Protests</li>
      
    </ol>
    
    The maps on this page will show the population of Iran and the geography of these protests: Where they are dispersed in the country and the number of deaths,
    detainees, and participants at large.

  <h2>
    <img src="1999.jpg" class="header-image"> The 1999 Student Protests 
  </h2>

  <p>
    If I could summarize this protest in three words, it would be <strong>students, newspaper, and reformist efforts</strong>.
    To protest the closure of a reformist newspaper called "Salaam," many students at Tehran University. The protests 
    started peacefully but quickly turned violent when police set dormitories with students in them on fire. What is
    important to garner from the tragic events of this protest is understanding a) the location and b) the flashpoint. The
    the epicenter of this protest was Tehran but also spread to other major cities, Tabriz and Isfahan. 
  </p>

  <h2>
    <img src="2009.jpg" class="header-image">The 2009 Green Movement 
  </h2>

  <p>
    The 2009 Green Movement was a mass mobilizer of the Iranian people. The slogan of the protest was, "Where is my vote?"
    The Presidential Election was between Mir Hossein Mousavi, a reformist, and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a conservative. 
    The government alleged that Ahmadinejad had won in a landslide to which millions of Iranian people took to the streets to
    fight for democracy and liberalization. Looking at the geography of this protest, we can see the mass spread of this protest.
    People all over the country and in the nation's top 10 major cities. The protest epicenters were located in different parts of the country,
    not just Tehran. 
  </p>

  <h2>
    <img src="2017.png" class="header-image">The 2017-18 Economic Price Hikes
  </h2>

  <p>
    This protest was rooted in the high cost of living and the price increase of basic commodities. The epicenter of this protest 
    started in Mashhad which happens to be the second largest city in Iran. The protests, however, did end up spreading to other 
    major cities in the region which you can see in the map. Some important slogans from this protest are: <strong>"Not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran,” 
    and "Leave Syria, think about us.”</strong>
  </p>

   <h2>
    <img src="2019.jpg" class="header-image">The 2019 Price Hike Protests
  </h2>

  <p>
    The 2019 Price Hike Protests were instigated by an almost 300% increase in gas prices and a new oil rationing system. Hundreds of thousands
    of people took to the streets with the epicenters of the protests also scattered across the major cities in the country. The tone of this
    the protest was much more anti-governmental with chants like, <strong>"Have shame Rouhani, Leave the country alone!"</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>
    <img src="2020.jpg" class="header-image">The 2020 January Protests
  </h2>

  <p>
    In January 2020, it became known that the Revolutionary Guard mistakenly shot down the Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752. The people on the flight, close 180, died. 
    These protests were more university-based with the main epicenter being in Tehran. Many cired out, "Clerics get lost!"
